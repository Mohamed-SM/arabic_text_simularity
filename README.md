## The API server with Python

I have used **Python2** but i should work with python3 without problems

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
then run following commands:

```
python sim.py
```

## The Vue Client

the vue client is optional, but a good way to test the API without doing any more work

```
cd client

```

```
npm install 
# or
yarn install
```

```
npm run serve
# or
yarn serve
```
